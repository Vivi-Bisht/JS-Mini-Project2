-> Parent Element (div) : Set position: relative; to make it the reference for child positioning.
-> Child Element (div) : Set position: absolute; so it positions inside the parent, not the whole page.

-> Basic Positioning : Use top, left, right, bottom to place the child within the parent while using absolute and relative.

-> Perfect Centering : Using only top: 50%; left: 50%; moves the top-left corner of the child to the center.

-> To fully center the child, add : transform: translate(-50%, -50%); 
   This shifts the child back by 50% of its own width and height, making it truly centered.
